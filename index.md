# Background

I am currently a student rapidly approaching the end of my degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. I first started this path as a Computer Science student on the path to becoming a software developer. As much as I enjoyed the problem solving, mathematics, and skillset that came along with software development, I quickly decided that it was not for me. That lead me to discovering the world of Cybersecurity. Since then, I have been awarded the CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ certifications as well as began to narrow in on a specified career path to focus in on as my coursework has done a wonderful job of laying the informational foundation.

# Coding Proficiency and Experience

**Beginner**: Followed walkthroughs, little understanding of syntax
**Little Experience**: Able to read code and lightly understand its function
**Intermediate**: Write small projects or scripts without notes or walkthroughs
**Advanced**: Well versed in syntax, able to write and debug without external aid

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
