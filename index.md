# Background

I am currently a student rapidly approaching the completion of my degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. I first started this path as a Computer Science student on the path to becoming a software developer. As much as I enjoyed the problem solving, mathematics, and skillset that came along with software development, I quickly decided that it was not for me. That lead me to discovering the world of Cybersecurity. Since then, I have been awarded many certifications as well as began to narrow in on a specified career path to focus in on as my coursework has done a wonderful job of laying the informational foundation.

I plan to continually update this webpage as I continue to reach milestones or achievements. This page will serve as insight into my previous works in totality.
